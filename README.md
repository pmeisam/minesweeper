<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

I used Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

[Lets go to the game](http://www.meisam.org/projects/)

The game is about finding the hidden mines. Each box you click on will either show a number of mines around each box or a mine. If there is no number it means that there is no mine around it.
You can put a flag by right-clicking anywhere you think there is a mine. If you click all the boxes without clicking a mine, you will win.


In the below section of code, I used recursion to expand the boxes if there is no mine.

In the below section of code I used jQuery to animate the start button and get the values of the numbers of mines and columns. I had to change the width of my boxes for different screen sizes using jQuery, so if the user inputs a larger number of columns, it will automatically change the size of the board.

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
My plan for the future is to add the ability to choose between beginner, intermediate, and advanced modes.
